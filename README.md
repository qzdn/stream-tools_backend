# Twitch tools backend

Backend for my personal Twitch tools like various APIs fetch, song requests and more. This project is designed to gain hands-on experience with Python, APIs, and backend development in general. You can deploy Docker image to [Render.com](https://docs.render.com/web-services#deploy-from-a-container-registry).
